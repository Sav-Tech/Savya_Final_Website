        <h1>Multitasking</h1>
        <p>Mental well-being is very important for everyone. While everyone focuses on physical well-being, not many people are focusing on their mental health. Mental health can affect how you think, feel and act. Hence, keeping your mental health in check is very important. One of the biggest causes for mental health is multitasking. Researchers say that doing several things at the same time can reduce your productivity level by almost 40%. People who juggle several tasks at the same time tend to waste 25%-40% of their time more than people who focus on tasks individually. Since multitasking is a misunderstood concept, people should know more about its problems, facts, and solutions.

            It is vital to know how to identify multitasking and why it is such a problem. Doing many things at once can feel productive, but it can actually slow us down and lower our performance. A recent study proves that the more devices teens use while multitasking, the worse they perform on tests. In the study, about 70 middle schoolers were asked how many hours per week they spend on video games, TV, texting, social media, etc. After that, they were asked how many of those activities they did at the same time. Overall, about 25% of all students were multitasking. Those who spent more time multitasking performed worse on academic tests compared to those who were doing independent tasks. Consequently, the students who multitasked also scored lower grades on memory tests because their mind was always distracted and they couldn’t focus on any task. When we keep switching tasks our brain loses focus on important things and we end up having to remind ourselves what to do. "For tasks that are at all complicated, no matter how good you have become at multitasking, you're still going to suffer hits against your performance. You will be worse compared to if you were concentrating from start to finish on the task” (Hamiltion, 2008). Multitasking with more complex or unfamiliar tasks can cause longer delays with even more mistakes. Those short delays can have real-world consequences, like a tenth of a second between answering your phone and driving can cause an accident. Hence, multitasking is a serious problem and needs to be solved.

            Despite the evident fact that multitasking is a significant problem, there are some interesting details about it. Most people wouldn’t know why it is so hard to stop multitasking. Whenever we finish a task our brain releases Hormone Dopamine. Hormone Dopamine makes us feel like we have been awarded. Hence we keep on multitasking even if we make more mistakes and start doing activities slower, our brain will not stop releasing Dopamine. “An average employee who uses a computer for work gets distracted once every 10.5 minutes” (Graphs.net,2012). If you think that you can multitask, you probably can’t. Studies show that only 2% of people can really multitask. That means that for the remaining 98% of people, juggling is detrimental. Consequently, people who multitask tend to waste more time compared to people who focus on one task at a time.

            Even though technology these days has made it hard to avoid multitasking, there are some solutions. Firstly, you should put away all the things that you think might distract you. This includes social media, video games, and cell phones. Then find a quiet place to work where nobody will disturb you. You shouldn’t be sitting in places like parks, train stations, or cafes. Finally, schedule a time for specific tasks and try not to get too distracted. A few key things to remember while you're working are to focus on each task individually, only keep assignments that you are using open, keep your work area organized, and stop the temptation of getting diverted.

            I personally believe that mental wellness is very important as it can affect everyone. Around 400 million people suffer from mental illness annually. So, if we don’t focus on our mental health then there will be a domino effect on our physical health. As I mentioned before, multitasking is a misunderstood concept which needs to be identified. When people juggle their tasks they think that it is making them more productive when actually it is just affecting their capability. That is why I suggest that you work on each task independently. A few tips to avoid multitasking are to put away all things that might distract you, find a quiet place to work and schedule specific times for tasks. Multitasking should be identified not only because it’s so harmful, but also because of its interesting facts and solutions.
