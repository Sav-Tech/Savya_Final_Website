        <h1>How People can Reduce Food Waste</h1>
        <p>Food waste is a bigger problem than many people imagine. Nearly â…“ of all food produced is wasted. When people throw their food away they need to realize that they are playing a major part in climate change. Discarded food is thrown away into landfills where it rots and produces methane gas. Too much methane gas can destroy the ozone layer. When the ozone layer gets destroyed, more sunlight comes to Earth and causes climate change. Down below are some of the reasons I could think of to save food.

            People should shop smart and only buy what is on the list. Most people buy more than they need so that they can save time. Results have shown that when people buy in bulk then more food is wasted as they have to finish the food before it is expired. When they can not do so they have no other choice but to throw it away. Rather than buying everything at one time, people should take frequent trips to the store and only buy what they need.

            Another one of the biggest reasons that food is wasted is because people only buy fruits that look healthy. A lot of fruits are shaped differently, but that does not mean that they are harmful. In Germany, there is a store which collects all these weird shaped foods and almost expired food and sells it to people with an 80% discount. This is helpful to poor people as they are getting the chance to eat healthy food at a lower cost. Many people throw away food because it says that it is expired. But more than half the time they read the wrong date and waste the food. Several foods are still healthy after they are expired.
            People should save leftovers and eat them the next day as this can save time and money. People can save the leftovers from the day before and store it in their fridge to use it the next day. One can carry the leftover food for lunch and that way they can get home made lunches and save money by not eating out.

            People should save the peels of the fruits and use them to perk up their water. People usually take the peel of the fruits and throw them away thinking that it is useless. But actually, the skins still contain a huge amount of fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. People can also use these skins to flavor the drinking water and make it more delicious.
