        <h1>Dabbawalla</h1>
        <p>Dabbawalla sitting on a train platform waiting for the train. The 5,000+ dabbawalas in Mumbai City are known for their impressive service record. Every day they transport more than 100,000 dabbas throughout Mumbai. The dabbawalas have achieved their target at a very low cost, eco friendly way, and without any use of technology. The dabbawalas have delivered no matter what happens. Whether it was bad weather or terrorist attacks. Their system has attracted many people from all over the world such as Prince Charles. Many companies such as FedEx and Deliveroo have tried to copy their way, but none of them have been successful for over 100 years. The reason why they cannot succeed is that they cannot match the low cost. Dabbawalas work for themselves. There are 200 groups of 25 people. These groups work together and deliver food. The dabbawalas use the Mumbai Suburban Railway for transportation. They travel on the railway till as far as they can go and then they use their cycles or walk. There is a lot of demand for dabbawala as not many people get to eat good food. The only food they can eat is outside for an expensive cost. But dabbawala are very cheap. They charge 500 Rs per person every month.

            Every morning at 9:00 AM the dabbawala's go to the customer's house to receive the food. Then they bring it to the closest railway station and sort the dabbas. Then they go by train to the destination where it is re-sorted. After that, they deliver the dabbas to the office before lunchtime. Then in the afternoon, they do the same thing but in reverse order. The dabbawalas have to be consistent and they can not mess up. They have a very tight schedule and every second matters. If any of them miss a train or an order, they won't have time to feel sorry for themselves. They have to get up and continue their delivery. They always have a plan B. In each group they also have two or three extra people who will be there if anything goes wrong. If a new member wants to join the group then they will first have to follow another professional worker for six months and then they can start delivering the dabbas. If a dabbawalla works for ten years then they get promoted to manager. Their job is to help to sort and give direction/consequences. There are usually one or two managers in each group. After the dabbawalas are done delivering the dabbas then they can spend the afternoon finding customers and building relationships.
