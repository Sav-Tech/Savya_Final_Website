        <h1>Tribes in India Getting Medical Masks at No Cost</h1>
        <p>When the government was struggling to give masks to tribes deep inside the forest, the Chenchu Tribe decided to use their knowledge and made masks out of leaves. While everyone in the urban land was going around and requesting for masks, the Chenchu Tribe was going around their jungle and finding medical trees. Leaf masks are very helpful as the leaves have a lot of medicine in them and when we breathe the medicine goes inside us. The masks are also free of cost. There were no reported cases in the jungle because of their adequate masks. Each mask can last around 5 hours before it falls apart. Then it can get decomposed in the Earth, whereas the paper masks are more difficult to decay.
