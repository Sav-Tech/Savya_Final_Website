            She had a dream of being a billionaire when she was just 9 years old! Most of the people hadn't decided their life ahead when they were just 9 years old, but young Elizabeth had everything clear in her mind. Just like all the other famous businessmen she also started in Silicon Valley, California. When Elizabeth Holmes was 19 years old she dropped out of Stanford University and started a company called Theranos. Her goal was to make a little device that can run more than 100 blood tests with a little bit of blood. Her vision was very good as this could help a lot of people. Earlier just to take one test people would have to go to the doctor and give a lot of their blood away. Then the doctor would take it and do a lot of tests in their lab. This process would take thousands of dollars but the Elizabeths device you do it quickly and just in 2.99 dollars. Many people even considered her as the next Steve Jobs. To make an impression, she dressed like Steve Jobs and changed her voice. Her idea was brilliant but when she realized that her company could not make the device she started to fraud people. She told the world that this device works when it was actually faulty. This was very dangerous for people as if they get the wrong info they might take more/less of what they need and then eventually die. To secure her secret, Elizabeth tracked all of her employees both physically and digitally. She had to make sure that nobody tells the world the truth about her. Although three people figured it out and were going to tell the press when Elizabeth charged them for trading Theranos's secrets. This was legal as on the contract that the employees signed they were not allowed to tell anyone about Theranos. She convinced the judge and sentenced them to prison. Elizabeth needed to show the world her progress soon so he ordered dinner for the employees at 8:00 PM, hoping that they would stay longer and work harder.
