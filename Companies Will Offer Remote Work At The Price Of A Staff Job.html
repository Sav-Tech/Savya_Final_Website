        <h1>Companies will offer remote work at the price of a staff job. Take the deal.</h1>
        <p>Before the pandemic, the world thought that only 3% of the jobs could be done from home. But now, during the pandemic up to 40% of the jobs can be done at home. For example, a technology manager, people used to think that you can not perform this job from home as you need to attend meetings and create presentations. But now, you easily do this job at home as you can use zoom for meetings and presenting. Which is why a lot of companies are trying to make their employees work from home. Even after that pandemic is gone they want to continue the same way, as they will save money.

            When employees come to work the company has to pay an extra 25% incurrence money for each person. The company will also save money as they will not have to pay for the electricity bills at the office. Remote work will also be better for the employees as they can work from home. They will be able to spend more time with their family and may even be able to take short breaks. They could take a rest or go outside for some fresh air. They would also save money from transporting. They would be sitting at home. Remote working would l be a win-win for everyone.
